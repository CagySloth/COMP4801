        ********************************************************************************
        Please avoid running ``setup.py`` and ``develop``.
        Instead, use standards-based tools like pip or uv.

        This deprecation is overdue, please update your project and remove deprecated
        calls to avoid build errors in the future.

        See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/917 for details.
